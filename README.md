# breast-cancer-detection
 Breast cancer detection by applying a logistic regression model on a real-world dataset and predict whether a tumor is benign (not breast cancer) or malignant (breast cancer) based off its characteristics.


1. Clump thickness
2. Uniformity of cell size
3. Uniformity of cell shape
4. Marginal adhesion
5. Single epithelial cell
6. Bare Nuclei
7. Bland chromatin
8. Normal nucleoli
9. Mitoses

Logistic regression can identify important predictors of breast cancer using odds ratios and generate confidence intervals that provide additional information for decision-making. Model performance depends on the ability of the radiologists to accurately identify findings on mammograms.
